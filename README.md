# Calculus-Operations
Basic code for Calculus derivation, integration, and more. Code will be inserted into apps later on.
Feel free to add on to the existing code.

Base derivation code is provided by Abhinav Arunkumar. Originally coded in Java. 
Code will be translated into Swift for use in iOS app design. No current plans to translate into other languages.
